After being inspired by multiple Instagram posts by [Lauren Currie](https://www.instagram.com/_laurencurrie_/channel/) (in particular, "How to find your fire"), I decided to finally bite the bullet and start a blog and to also have a go at writing down some things I believe in (in no particular order).

-   I believe that organisations can do better for the people they impact, both internal and external.
-   I believe that organisations should provide the tools and environment to enable their people to be at their best.
-   I believe that if organisations solve their problems in a people-centred way they will be more successful.
-   I believe in the power of breaking down silos and cross-organisation collaboration.
-   I believe that the best organisations are less bureaucratic, less political and have no egos.
-   I believe that organisations cling to ways of working that are not fit for todays world.
