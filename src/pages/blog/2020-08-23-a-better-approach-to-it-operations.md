The tools we need to do our jobs usually include IT equipment and software. Unfortunately, these tools often become one of the most frustrating daily interruptions to our productivity. It becomes the norm to hear someone, saying "sorry, my laptop just died" or "I'm still waiting for IT to get back to me about that, I can't access it right now". There's also the part where organisations provide software that just isn't conducive to collaborative working or adds extra time to get something done as it's not really optimal for the task at hand. Something that has been exacerbated by Covid-19 and the need for remote working.

Research conducted in 2007, based on 3,000 respondents working at organisations with 250+ UK employees, showed that employees spent approximately 7 days a year with reduced productivity due to IT issues and approximately 2 days a year unable to work at all due to IT issues. 64% of those surveyed felt frustrated if their IT systems were down for just five minutes, it's easy to see how this can start to impact morale.

There is one place I worked where this was rarely an issue, FinancialForce. I took it for granted at the time and it was only when I moved on and had to endure the old familiar experiences and comments I referred to above that I really appreciated this. My laptop just worked, I could work from wherever without any downtime or clunky sign-on procedures and the only time I had to speak to IT was to change the rechargeable batteries in my mouse.

I decided to get in touch with Richard the Senior IT Director at FinancialForce to explore his approach to operational IT. Before joining FinancialForce, Richard worked for CODA.

## Tell me about your IT background before FinancialForce?

In the early / mid 2000s when we were thinking about IT within CODA we always went for a very centralised approach. We didn't want to have IT servers and systems in each office. We put in really good quality network connections and then invested in making sure we had good servers in central locations. Before the words private cloud were knocking about we were in effect doing that. The overwhelming cost of having to not just buy a server and an application but to maintain and manage it, make sure you had disaster recovery and back-ups working, security patching, all that stuff was just huge amounts of work.

So you kind of take for granted now that your Google email is highly available and it's secure. Salesforce, Docusign and all those platforms you don't have to worry about too much. Of course you should assess your vendors properly, making sure they have robust security and processes.. Not having to worry too much about the availability and capability allows you to focus on the applications and the service to help transform your business, which is where we are now in terms of cloud and the way we offer our IT service. Obviously FinancialForce was born out of cloud first and was there from day one like that.

> We've always had quite a flat structure, very collaborative, lots of communication tools to help us work together.

## Tell me a bit about FinancialForce?

I think it was a very innovative idea, nearly 11 years ago now, to consider building a back-office accountancy solution on what was a front-office CRM solution. Seeing even in those early days that the Salesforce platform had the potential to take away some of that pain that we were just talking about such as security and availability and if you were going to deliver a finance management solution why would you not choose a really robust platform to do that on?

I think that as a company that kind of innovation and that collaboration, the way we have always worked as a business is testament to where we've got to now. We've always had quite a flat structure, very collaborative, lots of communication tools to help us work together. There's not many siloed departments within our organisation. I think everyone understands what their role is in trying to help move the company forward, the products, the services we offer and ultimately how we support our customers.

## How big is your team, how is the IT team structured?

We've got a team of 9 currently with 2 managers and we're based out of the west coast of the US and the UK and we service the global FinancialForce internal user base.

My team looks after endpoints, mobile phones and laptops, all the applications associated with that and some of the core infrastructure like email, Docusign those kind of SaaS applications, along with security related stuff. We work closely with the information security team on initiatives and ensuring that the laptops are secure and patched and we run the helpdesk for user queries. We do a mixture of the helpdesk work and then running projects to improve the service or deliver new functionality and new products.

> The team is the level above that, we're trying to make sure it's automated, integrated and that we're enabling people to use it to support their business processes or helping to transform the organisation.

## How many people work at FinancialForce now? I'm thinking that the number of people in IT seems quite lean in comparison.

There's about 675 employees now. I think the reason we can keep the IT team that lean is that we aren't actually running a lot of infrastructure ourselves so we obviously have things like firewalls, networking equipment within the offices but everything else is 100% cloud based delivery of IT service.

On a day to day basis we're not doing any IT work around making sure we can deliver an email service, there's no Microsoft Exchange to run, there's no Active Directory or anything like that. The team is the level above that, we're trying to make sure it's automated, integrated and that we're enabling people to use it to support their business processes or helping to transform the organisation. We put a lot of work in, to make sure that people know how to use the tools that we release into the organisation, to get the most out of them and to be effective.

## Tell me more about how you do that enablement?

We have a pretty standardised approach to this now. We communicate through multiple channels in different ways.

We have our IT newsletter that we put out quarterly and that will give updates on current stuff but also give a teaser about what's coming in the next quarter. We'll also use a combination of blog posts, Slack and email to announce things. We offer enablement via instructions with things like screenshots and we also do quite a lot of video stuff. We'll either demonstrate it in use or we'll do pieces to camera where we talk about what it does, drop in screenshots and just explain it to people.

People want to absorb information in different ways, some like to read it, some like to have it shown to them. We do drop in sessions and onboarding training sessions to try to help people that struggle to use some of that technology.

## When I was at FinancialForce it was mostly MacBooks that people used, is that still the case?

We're still about 90% Mac, we do that because we've built infrastructure that's more Mac forward and we've also built a team that's more comfortable supporting Mac.

I think we've probably seen a shift in the last two years where we've become a little bit more agnostic around that and if people want a PC they can have one. The reason for that is because we're so cloud first it actually doesn't really matter what the tool is that's used to access your browser and get into those applications, there's not much local process.

> Yeah, it's quite an old school view because surely everyone knows that the cost of providing your IT service is not the cost of buying the laptop.

## I'm interested in how the organisation supports that from a finance perspective. In a lot of organisations Mac's are seen as too expensive to purchase for most of the people working there.

Yeah, it's quite an old school view because surely everyone knows that the cost of providing your IT service is not the cost of buying the laptop. It's the cost of supporting it, patching it and securing it and every time you have some kind of malware attack there's a cost associated with that. If you can identify ways to reduce the ownership cost not the purchase cost, that's where you're saving the money.

Some organisations have large IT teams or they're having to run their own IT infrastructure and therefore have to spend a lot of time and effort maintaining it. They're therefore not investing their time in developing the delivery of the service, helping move the business forward, staying as agile as you can as a business. All that cost isn't anything to do with the purchase price of the physical hardware.

So, I think it can be a little bit short sighted. How reliable the laptops are, how robust they are, how secure they are is all value that is not listed in a spreadsheet. You have to look at the overall, the value of IT and the cost of managing and maintaining it. So, would I buy cheaper laptops and then employ another 5 people to look after them, I don't think that's a very effective thing to do. I'd rather have the reliable IT services and the laptops and have members of my team focused on closely working with the business units and departments to make sure we're delivering what they need to be effective.

> Some organisations have large IT teams or they're having to run their own IT infrastructure and therefore have to spend a lot of time and effort maintaining it. They're therefore not investing their time in developing the delivery of the service, helping move the business forward, staying as agile as you can as a business.

## Is there anything you've ever felt you've had to justify to the business or has it always been fully supported?

No, I don't think I have, not on the laptop front, I think that's always been quite clear because really it's the only assets we buy, we don't buy any servers or anything.

I think managing and maintaining software, SaaS licensing as a whole, is another area where I think it is a little bit more challenging for businesses, particularly as they scale and grow. Most SaaS providers are offering price per user per month for their service, which makes it very clear and easy to budget and manage. It's difficult sometimes to find the value when due to the nature of a role, someone is using that service every single day or every week against someone else who uses it sporadically, maybe three or four times a year. You're paying the same for both of those people, but usage profiles are different. You're having to work out the value they get from the software using it all the time vs. the few times someone else uses it.

## I'm curious about how restricted people are with their machines and the tools they need to use?

We've brought about a level of restriction more so than we did, say five years ago. We're centralising delivery of applications more, making sure that everyone's standardised, so that we don't have loads of different integrations with Gmail or Salesforce so that's kind of a mixture of productivity and enablement alongside the security aspect of it.

We're doing it in such a way that it's not really stopping anyone. It's more about making sure that if you need to use product X let's just check that we haven't already got product Y that does the same thing. Also, we can centrally manage that for you, we'll make sure it's up to date and it's security patched and all that kind of stuff. There's an expectation now, for some of the security certifications, that there is more control over the end points.

## What if someone needs to use a tool to get their job done that may not meet security standards? If you come across this, what do you do, would you explore alternative options?

If we had a department coming to us to say they wanted to use product X, some SaaS solution that solves a particular issue, let's say whiteboarding within design. We'd first check, do we have something like that already that can be used in that space so do we have some kind of collaboration tool that will enable that. If we don't, then we can do our security assessment but if it doesn't pass the security test we won't proceed with that vendor and we'll work together to find another that does meet our requirements.\

It's really important that we take trust and security really seriously, trust is our number one value. We do that for our own internal solutions to ensure that we're safe with our own company data.

> There's nothing more frustrating as a user than to log a ticket and it goes into a black hole and you don't know what's going on or where it's at, that is not happening at any IT organisation that I look after!...Really we're just focused on making people happy.

## How do you approach support?

So we have always wanted to be very transparent about how we offer IT support within FinancialForce. There's nothing more frustrating as a user than to log a ticket and it goes into a black hole and you don't know what's going on or where it's at, that is not happening at any IT organisation that I look after!

The main way people engage is Slack, so they'll ask the question in Slack and if it's a quick and simple thing we've seen before, we can reply back and help them straight away. Everyone knows how to use Slack and it's a super easy way. We've just got a channel, when you join the company it automatically puts you in it. We have a number of them actually, they're pre-fixed 'help-'. When we launch new services we might spin up a channel, particularly during the launch to provide focused support. If it's not resolvable straight away or it's more involved, or it's something like an access request or any kind of security related thing and we want to keep a good track and audit on that, we'll spin up a Zendesk ticket off the back. We've got a small Zendesk environment but it's all transparent and everyone can see what's going on.

Really we're just focused on making people happy.

## Is there much impact globally because of the choices you've made for the infrastructure?

Before Covid-19 we'd try and visit the sites at least twice a year. There is stuff like infrastructure patching, updating network switches, that kind of thing that you want to be onsite to do. We combine all that work together and we can do that out of hours when we're onsite.

It also allows us to be in the office and hear what's going on, the kind of problems people are facing, things are more likely to surface when you're in an office and someone's there. We just sit in the office and work alongside people, listen to some of the challenges and also we'll run training sessions or focus on a particular product launch for that office, to make sure that they're comfortable and also present what's going on on the IT roadmap and making sure people feel informed.

## What are your thoughts on being visible and the stereotype of IT being in a cupboard somewhere?

Particularly in the UK office, this probably sounds a bit grandiose but it's modelled on a kind of Apple Genius Bar idea. We have physical furniture that's laid out that allows people to walk up and put their laptop on a high, circular table and we can walk up and work with them.

We're not stuck behind things and when we do our new starter inductions we have a nice area where they can come, sit and go through that process. We try to make ourselves physically accessible in the office and obviously Slack is a great way to communicate but we'll just jump on Zoom calls with people and talk to them and try and understand their frustrations. Sometimes that doesn't come across in words very well so it's good just to show you are attentive and you care about the problem that they are experiencing and try to get it resolved. I think a video call is a good way of doing that.

## What impact has the growth of the organisation had on IT?

I think we've had to do more work on enablement. Self-sufficiency has been lost a little bit, we've kind of thrust people into a very cloudy environment and had to enable them to be successful in using it. Quite often it's the users that go on day one, 'I hate my Mac, give me a PC' and we're like, just persevere and then a few months later they're going 'oh this is great, it's super productive and I'm so glad I didn't go back and get what I was used to'.

It's first important to try and reassure people and make sure they feel open-minded enough just to try and you're going to support them. It's a bit like when you're learning to ride a bike, you need the stabilisers on for a bit and then you can take it off and they realise the freedom they've been given, it's pretty similar.

## Have you been impacted by Covid-19?

One of the really interesting things is that there hasn't been any impact really. We literally shut the offices, everyone went home and we made no changes to the IT infrastructure at all and everyone was able to still fully function and work with high levels of productivity.

Our biggest challenge was around making sure that as new starters join the organisation, they got a laptop on the first day. We were still able to do this but it was more about the logistics and couriers and that kind of stuff. We were worried the couriers would stop operating and we wouldn't be able to get stuff to people's houses or when people leave the organisation, getting hold of the equipment they're handing back. Fortunately, it's not got to that point and we've always been able to deliver what was required or collect what was needed.

So, literally no changes made, the infrastructure's always been designed that you could work from anywhere on secure devices and it's really come into its own this last three months.

## Can other organisations work this way or is it just the sector that FinancialForce is in that enables this?

Most IT and IS challenges you face within an organisation are about people using information systems and the processes around making sure they're highly available, all backed up, security patched and all that stuff. I would suggest it's extremely challenging for internal organisations, particularly smaller, medium sized businesses to provide that same level of security and resilience and business continuity themselves, than it is by using a cloud provider. Take Gmail or Office 365 by Microsoft, I think it's a brave IT person that says my team can run an email system better than Gmail and Microsoft because do you really think you want to invest the kind of money to do that?

I think organisations need to work out and focus on what their most critical information systems are and what's important to them. The stuff they feel comfortable with, definitely look at adopting the cloud and then go and look at providers that are doing it in a secure way.

So Salesforce are very focused on the security of their platform, we obviously have our software running on their platform and we get the benefit of that security environment. I just think there are a wide number of companies that are using cloud based services to support very sensitive businesses and doing it successfully and securely, so I think you have to at some point assess where the value is in trying to do it yourself.
