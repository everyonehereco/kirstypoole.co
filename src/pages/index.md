I believe organisations can do better for the people they impact, both internal and external. They can provide better tools, cultures and environments to enable their people to be at their best. This in turn will create more resilient, adaptive and successful organisations.\
\
I'm embarking on a mission to explore those who are innovating in this space and share my findings in the hope that it will encourage more organisations to reconsider how they work.\
\
If you know of any organisations or individuals that are rethinking or may have already changed how they do HR, culture, finance, operational IT, governance etc. I'd love to hear about them!\
